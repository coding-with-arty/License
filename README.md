## 🪖 My Journey

I served in the Army from 1999–2003. Came home broken, lost a friend, nearly lost myself — then I found purpose in code.  

**No handouts. No shortcuts. One mission: Build tools that matter.**

## ⚔️ My Ethos

- **Code like your life depends on it.**  
- **No fluff. No gimmicks. Just function and impact.**  
- **If it doesn’t run offline, it’s not ready for the real world.**  
- **Accessibility > Aesthetics. Clarity > Cleverness.**
